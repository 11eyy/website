        <h2>Burnham Park</h2>
        <p>About this place: Burnham Park, dubbed the city's "Mother of all Parks," is one of Baguio's most popular tourist destinations. It was named after American architect and urban planner Daniel Burnham, who created the park's original design and arrangement.

            Burnham Park is an open green park at the heart of Baguio. The park's lush greenery and blossoming blooms make you forget you're in the heart of a densely populated metropolis.
            
            Burnham Park is easily accessible; it is located along Harrison Road, just a short distance from Session Road, Baguio's main highway.
            
            The Park is divided into several clusters, each with its own set of activities and attractions, such as the Children's Playground, Rose Garden, Orchidarium, Picnic Grove, Igorot Garden, and so on.
            
            Apart from such features, Burnham Park is most renowned for its magnificent centuries-old artificial lake in the center called the Burnham Lagoon. Boating on the beautiful Lagoon is a must-do activity.</p>

        <h2>Night Market</h2>
        <p>About this place: Baguio is known for its inexpensive shopping. The Baguio Night Market is the place to go if you want to put your haggling abilities to the test. Every thrifty fashionista's dream comes true in this bargain-hunting paradise.

            A section of Harrison Road to the northeast of Burnham Park morphs into a flea market from 9:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. Thanks to the rows of ukay-ukay stalls, you may find everything you need to complete a casual style without burning a hole in your wallet.
            
            Ukay-ukay is the local phrase for surplus things shipped from other nations as well as second-hand clothing, luggage, and footwear offered at discounted costs.
            
            The ukay-ukay at the Baguio Night Market is overflowing. It's the finest location to find high-quality used jackets, boots, garments, and accessories at a fraction of their original cost.
            
            And if you're lucky or have excellent thrift-shopping talents, you might be able to obtain one-of-a-kind vintage finds or even mint-condition stuff.
            
            After shopping, head to the northern side of the hill for an ear of sweet corn, noodle soup, or other street cuisine.</p>
